# BrainStation-Hackathon-CatPosters
Created with CodeSandbox

This silly project was put together during a 4 hours Hackathon as part of my experience at BrainStation, alongside Kayle Robson.  It grabs new cat images (and their associated colour) and a motivational quote from an pen API, and turns all that into a motivational cat poster. 

Created using CodeSandbox, VanillaJS, HTML, SCSS, Axios.
