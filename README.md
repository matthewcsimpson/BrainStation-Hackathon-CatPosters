# BrainStation-Hackathon-CatPosters
Created with CodeSandbox

This silly project was put together during a 4 hours Hackathon as part of my experience at BrainStation, alongside [Kayle Robson](https://github.com/revyrob).  It grabs new cat images (and their associated colour) and a motivational quote from an pen API, and turns all that into a motivational cat poster. 

Created using CodeSandbox, JS, HTML, SCSS, Axios, HTML2Canvas.
